3.	LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.
There are various types of licenses and versions of the Program, which reflect the number of authorized installations and users and the permitted purposes of use, each of which is subject to different restrictions and limitations as set forth below.
3.1.	Type of License:
(a)	Single-User:  If Your License to use the Program is a single-user license, the Program and related data may be:  (i) installed on:  only one computer or workstation, or personal digital assistant, pager, "smart phone" or other similar electronic device which You own or use and for which the Program is designed to operate (a "Client Device"); and (ii) accessed and used only by the specific individual to whom the Program is licensed.  The component parts of the Program may not be installed or used individually or jointly in full or in part on more than one Client Device, unless otherwise set forth herein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the connection manager component may be installed on one server and accessed by only one Client Device for the sole purpose of hosting the company data file.

In the event a Named User is temporarily out of the office (vacation, leave, illness, etc.) or leaves Your company, You may replace this Named User with a new associate of Your company without purchasing a license for an additional Named User.
(c)	In accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement, if You are entitled to use Sage Drive, You will also be permitted to install the Program on one (1) additional Client Device in addition to the number of installations allowed in this Agreement to facilitate the sharing of the Program data through Sage Drive.
(d)	Sysadmin User Account:  The sysadmin user account is an administrative account that does not require its own license to use the Program unless You want it installed on a separate Client Device.
(e)	Subscription: A Subscription License to the Program requires a minimum one (1) year commitment and lasts only as long as Your subscription fees are current, or until Your subscription term ends, or until this Agreement is terminated as described herein.  In order to have a Subscription License, the Program must be installed on a Client Device that is connected to the Internet.  You must be using the most current version of the Program and agree that You will update to the most current version as soon as it is available to You. Depending on the term You selected, Your subscription period is annual, with the subscription fees payable each year or each month.  Your subscription is autorenewing for the term length You selected and Sage will notify You prior to charging You for the renewal.  You may cancel Your subscription with at least ten (10) daysâ€™ notice to Sage prior to Your renewal date.  Please note that any of the following will cause Your Program to revert to "read only" mode: (1) failure to pay Your subscription fee; (2) termination of this Agreement (3) cancellation or non-renewal of Your subscription; or (4) if You are a Sage Accountants Network ("SAN") member and fail to pay Your SAN fees.  Full Program functionality will not be restored until You reactivate your account, which may require payment of all past due subscription fees plus a reactivation fee.
3.2.	Permissible Uses:
(a)	Full Retail Version:  If the Program is a full retail version, You may use the Program only for Your business or professional use.
(b)	Not for Resale/Demo Version:  The Not for Resale version of the Program (an "NFR Version") may be licensed and used only by persons that have entered into a valid and current partner or other similar agreement with Sage (each, an "Other Sage Agreement").  If the Program is an NFR Version, You may use the Program only for demonstration, marketing, promotional, end user support, training, or development purposes, and only to the extent permitted or required under the applicable Other Sage Agreement.
(c)	Student Version:  The Student Version of the Program (a "Student Version") may be licensed only by individuals that meet the applicable student qualifications as set forth on the Program packaging or on the http://na.sage.com/ca/partners Web site.

You may use it only pursuant to this Agreement and the terms of Your Sage Accountants Network membership.  A SAN member may use a License belonging to a third party in order to access that partyâ€™s files as required by their business relationship.
3.3.	General Restrictions Applicable to All Kinds of Licenses and Permissible Uses
(a)	You may not sell, distribute, lease, rent or sublicense the Program.
(b)	You may not reverse-engineer, reverse-translate, disassemble, or decompile the Program, or any portion thereof, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structural framework of the Program.

Use of software, hardware or services that bypass any Program license restrictions and/or reduce the number of Client Devices users and/or seats, as may be applicable, accessing or utilizing the Program (e.g., "multiplexing," "pooling," or third party add on software or hardware) expressly does not reduce the number of licenses required (i.e., the required number of licenses would equal the number of distinct inputs to the multiplexing or pooling software or hardware "front end").
(e)	You may not use or permit any other person (including without limitation any parent, affiliate or subsidiary organization) to benefit from the use or functionality of the Program, either directly or via a facility management, timesharing, service bureau or any other arrangement; provided, however, that You may use the Program, as provided herein, to process the data of an affiliate or subsidiary of which You own more than fifty percent (50%); provided, however, You may not exceed the number of companies specified on the applicable product packaging or accompanying documentation.
(f)	You may not install the Program on more Client Devices than You have Licenses and only licensed Named Users may access the Program, except as may be permitted by this Agreement.  Sage may verify compliance of license entitlement and restrict use of the Program if it determines that You have violated the terms of this Agreement.
(g)	You may not share a license.  Each user of the Program must have their own license, including all part-time employees.
(h)	Using the Software in excess of (i) the limitations set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) the number and types of users, seats or licenses You purchase or rightfully acquire. Use of the Software in excess of the number and type of licenses You purchased constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and (1) You agree to pay to Sage the additional license or subscription fees due for the unpaid use calculated in accordance with the applicable Sage retail price list in effect at the time payment is made, and (2) failure to make the foregoing payment within 30 days of Sageâ€™s invoice date is also a material breach of this Agreement and results in the automatic termination of this Agreement without notice.

Sage will have no responsibility for the Program if any portion of the Program has been modified, lost, stolen or damaged by accident, abuse or misapplication.
